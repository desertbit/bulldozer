===========================
=== Bulldozer TODO List ===
===========================

* Fix the context bug, where static set DOM IDs and style classes are not reused on function events. If this is fixed, then uncomment the commented lines in dialog.go

IMPORTANT
=========
* Implement utils.SendMail and send the registration mail...
* bulldoze: don't initialize the project folder automatically. Implement a init command.
* Bulldozer.socket.send: clear the queue after a short timeout.
* The connectionlost widget showsup sometimes, even if the connection is still valid.
* Don't load scripts and javascripts twice if already added to the HTML head!
* Only show the utils.errorBox error code and 500 error template error message if the user is authenticated as developer.
* Search for old naming and replace it:
  -> grep -R "Bulldozer.core.loadPage" ./
  -> grep -R "Bulldozer.core.loadDefaultPage" ./
* Remove old removed $.DialogId...


STYLE
=====
* Fix the overflow in the loading indicator (Is this still present?).
* Style the not found and error core template pages.
* Implement the unused errorbox.
* Add the description links to the noscript template: <a class="button">How to enable JS?</a><a class="button">What is JS?</a>


AUTHENTICATION
==============
* Add log messages if any user data is changed.
* Add template package calls or js methods to login, logout and register.
* Add an option to add a user without automatic deletion if not logged in and confirmed.
* Implement user confirmation over e-mail after registration.
* Include a notice, that a new registered user is removed after 2 days, if not logged in the first time.
* Change Password:
  - Don't allow to set the same password: old password != new password.
  - Match the password to following Regexp: Passwords must be at least 8 characters with 1 capital letter and 1 number
  - require to validate the old password first before changing...
  Implement:

  - https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
* getUsers: Add an option to retrieve batched users. Don't return all at once!
* Check on registration, if the e-mail already exists.
* Is it possible to add for each user a custom salt to the db?
* Encrypt the password transmition of a new set password.


SECURITY
========
* Nginx no sniff headers in configuration.
* Implement better database password hash encryption.
* Set cookie max age to settings.Settings.SessionMaxAge if authenticated.
* Burteforce prevention for socket requests. Detect flooding...
* Clients with the same session cookie from different IPs and countries should be blocked!
* Set the secure cookie flag if the session is authenticated and if it is a https connection (Don't mix this up with nginx https)
* Make the cookie non persistant.
* Change session IDs on authentication.
* [Optional] Rotate sessions frequently to new ones and replace the old once (Delete session store?)
* [Optional] Set Cookie Path to restricted area


Session & Socket
=============
* If a session connects after serveral retries with a different socket type, then a endless loop occurres. This is currently fixed temporary, by disabling automatic fallback in the client javascript code.


General
=======
* Add the site administrators e-mail to the error page.
* Maybe remove the core templates from the bulldozer templates and read them to the mainTemplate. This could be less overhead...
* If some core templates exists (example: auth) in the project folder, then load them instead of the bulldozer default templates.
* Watch for core template changes and reload them also.
* Log sass build errors to a gui page...
* Do some performance testing to check for bottlenecks (session store?)



Features
========
* Reload dialog templates automatically on file changes if loaded with dialog.ParseFile.
* Add optional arg to template.Glob to load recursive templates.
