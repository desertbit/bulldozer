===========================
=== Bulldozer TODO List ===
===========================
 



* Load the title from the page template!!!!!
* create a new main.go in the project folder if not present.
* create settings file...
* Handle socket.send return false
* Hide the loading indicator after 10 seconds and show an error message!
* If the main session ID is invalid, then perform a complete page reload!



IMPORTANT
=========
* Webcrawler support & sitemaps.
* Finish the must action in the template execute method call. Also add an error action.
* Don't load scripts and javascripts twice if already added to the HTML head!
* Only show the utils.errorBox error code and 500 error template error message if the user is authenticated as developer.
* Load a config in the Init() method if the file exists and the ENV is set.


STYLE
=====
* Fix the overflow in the loading indicator.
* Style the not found and error core template pages.
* Implement the unused errorbox.
* Add the description links to the noscript template: <a class="button">How to enable JS?</a><a class="button">What is JS?</a>


SECURITY
========
* Nginx no sniff headers in configuration.
* Implement better database password hash encryption.
* Set cookie max age to settings.Settings.SessionMaxAge if authenticated.
* Burteforce prevention for socket requests. Detect flooding...
* Clients with the same session cookie from different IPs and countries should be blocked!
* Set the secure cookie flag if the session is authenticated and if it is a https connection (Don't mix this up with nginx https)
* Make the cookie non persistant.
* Change session IDs on authentication.
* [Optional] Rotate sessions frequently to new ones and replace the old once (Delete session store?)
* [Optional] Set Cookie Path to restricted area


Session Store
=============
* Implement Flash messages (Do we need this feature?).


General
=======
* Maybe remove the core templates from the bulldozer templates and readd them to the mainTemplate. This could be less overhead...
* Watch for core template changes and reload them also.
* Log sass build errors to a gui page...
* Do some performance testing to check for bottlenecks (session store?)
