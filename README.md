# Bulldozer - A Rock Solid and Secure Web Framework

***This project is deprecated. It is stable to use, but far from ready.***

The Bulldozer Framework focuses on high security. There are no HTML form request or any further POST and GET requests as used in normal web applications. A new secure transport and communication layer is added to the web application. Each request is authenticated by unique tokens saved on the server side. A new session store was developed for this. Server push messages to the client are as easy as requests to the server.

There is a helper service called bulldoze. Check the README in the bulldoze directory.

Further documentation will follow soon.
